T20 world cup cricket Data Analysis-  [Python | Pandas | Power BI]

•I have created a Power BI report to identify the top 11 players for a T20 cricket team by data from ESPN Cricinfo, cleaning and transforming the data with pandas, and evaluating various player performance metrics.
• Used the resulting Power BI dashboard to select players for various categories (openers, middle order/anchors,
finishers, all-rounders, specialist fast bowlers) and ultimately choose the top 11 players to play in the match.
• Selected team using the Power BI dashboard has a 90% chance of winning the game.

NOTE: 
In order to view the dashboard you will need the Power BI application installed on your device.
